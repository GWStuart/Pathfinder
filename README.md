# Pathfinder
A pathfined project using real world road data and written entierly in C. 

Program implements Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* search optimised to run efficiently on large real world road networks with tens of thousands of nodes.

See below an image of the programming loading Brisbane City road data.

## Features
This project implements the following features:
- Geojson data parsing and cleaning (including road partitioning and neighbour parsing)
- Graphics rendering with SDL3
- Dynamic mouse panning and zooming
- Toggleable node visibility
- Efficient pathfinding using a binary heap implementation
- Animated search algorithms
- Smooth and responsive performance even on large road networks
- Command line parsing

## Compilation
Use the provided [Makefile](Makefile) however ensure that the following dependencies are satisffied:
- `pkg-config` (used by the Makefile to automatically pass c flags and linker flags)
- SDL3 + SDL_ttf (see [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage))

## Usage
After building the program you should have a `vis` exectable file and the basic usage is as shown below,
```
./vis PathToDataFile
```
The `PathToDataFile` should be the name associated with the output files generated by `formatData.py` (**without including any file extensions**). To load Brisbane city data use `assets/data/BrisbaneCentre` which I have included already in this github repository. For more information on how to load your own custom road network see the end of this README.

Additional (optional) command line options:
- `-h <HEIGHT>` to specify screen height
- `-w <WIDTH>` to specify screen width
- `--alg <ALG>` to specify the pathfinding algorithm to be used. Can be either `dijkstra` (default) or `astar`

<br>

Most other features within the program itself are quite self explanatory but here is some additional detail:
- Pan around with the mouse and zoom with the scroll wheel
- Toggle node rendering with the `n` key
- Click to select the pathfinding start and end nodes
- Press space to then run the pathfinder

## Loading Other City Data
Within this github repository I already provide the processed data for the Brisbane City centre. To load this data use the following command,
```
./vis assets/data/BrisbaneCentre
```

To load your own custom road network you need to download OpenMap data for a particular region as a GeoJson file and then processing it using the formatData.py script. I will add more details on how to do this in future.
